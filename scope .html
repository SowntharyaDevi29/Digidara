The Paperless Student Complaint Management System is designed to revolutionize the way student complaints are handled in educational institutions by providing a secure, digital platform for submission, tracking, and resolution. This system eliminates the need for physical paperwork, ensuring faster communication between students and administrators.

The system enables students to register complaints through an online portal by logging in with secure credentials. Each complaint is linked to the student's verified information, ensuring authenticity and traceability. Complaints are categorized (e.g., canteen, hostel, exam, staff) and stored in a centralized database for administrative access. Administrators can review complaints and update their status as pending, resolved, or in progress, which can be viewed by students in real-time. This creates a transparent feedback loop.

The scope of the project includes:

Secure student and admin login modules.

Online complaint submission with structured student verification.

A tracking system via email to view complaint history and statuses.

An admin dashboard for efficient complaint resolution and updates.

A MySQL backend for storing complaints and user data securely.

User-friendly front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


This system can be further expanded to include features such as:

Push notifications for complaint updates.

Analytics for identifying recurring issues.

Feedback/rating system for complaint resolution.


Overall, the Paperless Student Complaint Management System ensures transparency, efficiency, and accountability while improving student satisfaction and institutional responsiveness.
