SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
5.1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project presents a secure and efficient Paperless Student Complaint System, developed to streamline the grievance submission and resolution process within academic institutions. The system aims to eliminate the need for manual paperwork by allowing students to submit complaints digitally using a verified login portal. Once authenticated through their registration number, department, and year, students can access the platform to register complaints under predefined categories such as Hostel, Staff, Exam, Sports, and Others.

The project utilizes the Flask web framework and integrates MySQL for backend data management, ensuring smooth storage and retrieval of complaint records. The front-end interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a user-friendly and responsive experience. Each complaint is stored with a timestamp and is made viewable to both students and the admin.

Admins can log in through a secured dashboard to view, filter, and respond to complaints, including updating complaint statuses in real time. Email notifications and in-dashboard alerts can be integrated to keep students informed about the progress of their complaints.

The system also includes modules for complaint tracking, categorization, and history viewing, enabling complete transparency and accountability. By leveraging digital infrastructure, the Paperless Student Complaint System not only saves time and resources but also ensures a faster, traceable, and more organized approach to grievance redressal in academic environments.

With a scalable architecture and optional features like voice-based input, attachment support, and analytics, the system is poised to bring transformative improvements to student service management in colleges and universities.

5.2. MODULES DESCRIPTION


---

1. Student Complaint Submission UI

The user interface is developed using Flask and integrated with MySQL for data management. The web interface allows students to log in with verified credentials (username and password) and then access the complaint form. The form includes fields such as name, registration number, department, year, email, category selection, and complaint description. This UI provides a clean, interactive, and responsive design to simplify the complaint submission process.


---

2. Student Authentication Module

This module verifies student credentials before allowing access to complaint-related pages. The authentication is performed using MySQL queries with Flask sessions to maintain user login state. Only valid, registered users are allowed to submit complaints or view their submitted issues.


---

3. Complaint Processing Module

Once a complaint is submitted, this module captures the data and stores it in a structured format in the database. Each complaint is timestamped and associated with the student's profile. The backend ensures data validation and sanitization to maintain integrity and security.


---

4. Admin Login and Dashboard

The admin interface includes a secure login system. Once authenticated, the admin can:

View all complaints in a table format

Filter complaints based on category, date, or status

Update complaint status (Pending, In Progress, Resolved)

Provide remarks and feedback


The dashboard is dynamic and updates in real-time using AJAX or JavaScript integration.


---

Student login details

Complaint data

Admin remarks and updates The database schema is normalized and indexed to ensure fast access and scalability.



---

9. Data Security and Validation

Security measures include:

Password hashing using werkzeug.security

SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

Session-based login system

Input validation on both client and server side
