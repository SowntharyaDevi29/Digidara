ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN
The architecture of the Paperless Student Complaint System is designed to streamline the process of complaint registration, tracking, and resolution in a fully digital environment. The system follows a structured pipeline that ensures data validation, secure submission, and efficient complaint management by students and administrators.
1. User Interface (Frontend)
- Students and Admins access the web portal through an intuitive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and Flask templates.
- The interface allows login, complaint submission, viewing complaint status, and admin response.
2. Authentication & Authorization
- Student Login: Verified via registration number, department, year, username, and password.
- Admin Login: Admins authenticate with a secure ID and password.
- Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized actions (e.g., only admins can update status).
3. Complaint Submission Module
- After successful login, students can fill out a complaint form with fields like:
  - Complaint Title
  - Description
  - Category (e.g., hostel, staff, exam, canteen)
  - Date of Submission
- Data is validated client-side and server-side before processing.
4. Complaint Processing & Storage
- On submission, complaints are stored in a MySQL database using flask_mysqldb.
- Each complaint is tagged with a unique ID and linked to the student's account via their email or registration number.
5. Admin Dashboard Module
- Admins can view all submitted complaints categorized by status:
  - New
  - In Progress
  - Resolved
- Admins can update the status and provide feedback, which is instantly reflected in the student's dashboard.
6. Complaint Status Tracker
- Students can track their complaint status in the "My Complaints" page.
- They receive real-time updates and response history related to each complaint.
7. Notifications & Feedback
- Flash messages notify users of successful logins, submission, or updates.
- Optional: Email alerts or SMS can be added in future enhancements.
8. Database Design
- Key tables:
  - users: Stores student login credentials and verification info.
  - complaints: Contains all complaint records, including timestamps, status, and admin responses.
  - admins: Stores admin credentials.
9. Security Measures
- Passwords are hashed using werkzeug.security.
- Sessions are managed securely using Flask session cookies and secret keys.
- Inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks.
10. Deployment Environment
- The application is hosted on a local server using WAMP or Flask's development server.
- It can be deployed online using platforms like Render, Heroku, or PythonAnywhere for wider access.
