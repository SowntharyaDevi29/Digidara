During my internship at DigiDara Technologies Private Limited in Trichirapalli, my learning journey was structured into three progressive phases: foundational training, practical implementation, and project development. In the first five days, I focused on learning the fundamentals of web development and database management, including an overview of full-stack development, front-end technologies (HTML, CSS), backend frameworks (Python Flask), and relational databases (MySQL). I explored the applications of web-based systems in educational institutions, particularly for complaint management, which provided a strong theoretical base. In the next ten days, I transitioned to hands-on development, where I honed my programming skills using Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. I practiced designing responsive user interfaces with interactive animations (e.g., slide-in forms, hover effects), building RESTful APIs with Flask, and managing database operations such as creating tables, writing queries, and ensuring data integrity. In the final fifteen days, I applied all the knowledge and skills gained to develop a real-time project titled "Paperless Student Complaint System." This phase involved designing a responsive front-end interface using HTML and CSS with a light blue and green color scheme, developing a Flask-based backend for handling complaint submissions, integrating a MySQL database for storing and retrieving complaints, and implementing features like student verification (using Registration Number, Department, and Year) and predefined complaint categories (STAFF, SPORTS, CANTEEN, EXAM, WATER FACILITY, OTHER). The system was tested under real-world challenges such as handling concurrent users, ensuring data security, and maintaining cross-browser compatibility. The project achieved a user-friendly interface with seamless functionality, enabling efficient complaint submission and tracking for students and administrators. This structured schedule enabled a smooth progression from theoretical learning to practical expertise and full-scale web application development.
