In modern academic institutions, managing student complaints efficiently and transparently is essential to maintaining a healthy academic environment. Traditional complaint systems often involve paper-based processes, which are time-consuming, prone to loss of records, and lack real-time tracking mechanisms. To address these limitations, this project presents a Paperless Student Complaint System, a web-based platform developed using Flask and MySQL, aimed at streamlining the entire complaint handling process. The system enables students to securely sign up and log in, submit complaints with verified academic credentials, and track the real-time status of their submissions. Verification is performed using student-specific details such as register number, department, and year, ensuring only authentic students can access the system. Each complaint is categorized and stored in a structured database, and students receive updates as the status changes (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Resolved). On the administrative side, authorized staff can log in to view all complaints, update statuses, and manage submissions efficiently through a centralized dashboard. This project integrates secure authentication, form validation, and structured data handling, significantly reducing paperwork and administrative workload while increasing transparency and responsiveness. By implementing digital record-keeping and real-time status tracking, the system empowers students with visibility over their concerns and enhances accountability among administrators. The outcome is a robust, scalable solution that can be extended across educational institutions to support digital transformation and improve student satisfaction.
